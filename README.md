# Speech Processing for AMD Open Hardware Competition

This repository contains code, documentation, and resources for a speech processing project developed for the AMD Open Hardware Competition. The project aims to leverage open hardware platforms and advanced speech processing techniques to enable innovative audio applications.

## Features

- Speech signal acquisition and preprocessing
- Feature extraction (MFCC, spectrograms, etc.)
- Speech recognition and classification
- Real-time audio processing support
- Integration with AMD open hardware platforms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AMD open hardware platform (e.g., FPGA, SoC, or development board)
- Python 3.x or C++ (depending on implementation)
- Required libraries (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) if available)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AnubhavAvinash/Speech-Processing
    cd Speech-Processing
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

- Refer to the example scripts in the `examples/` directory.
- Modify configuration files as needed for your hardware setup.
- Run the main processing pipeline:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure
